DONE: Add options for determining distribution of each problem type? (-t allows listing multiple same-type options e.g. algen.py -c 5 -t 122333)
Add function to generate each type of problem as a word problem instead of an equation
Add check for negative values passed to geometry exercises
Rearrange type flags so similar level exercises are near each other (and specific types come after similar generic types)
Generate PNG images for geometric exercises
Generate graphing exercises
Better bounding for fraction generators
Track down area bug
Move all display commands out of showtabledrill module
Generate a GUI (GTK) front end for algen
GUI module should output exercises/keys to various formats (txt, htm, rtf, xml)
Make an array for x values so x won't be repeated and add a flag for minimum distance between problems with same unknown

Tweak triangle function so it can ask for just x instead of area/perim
