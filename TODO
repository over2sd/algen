DONE: Add options for determining distribution of each problem type? (-t allows listing multiple same-type options e.g. algen.py -c 5 -t 122333)
Add function to generate each type of problem as a word problem instead of an equation
Add check for negative values passed to geometry exercises
Rearrange type flags so similar level exercises are near each other (and specific types come after similar generic types)
Generate PNG images for geometric exercises
Generate graphing exercises
Better bounding for fraction generators
When generating fractional coefficients, reroll part1/part2 if part1=part2
Integrate fractional coefficients into all exercise types
