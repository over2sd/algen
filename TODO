Add geometry problem find area/perim given two values of a quadrilateral
Add options for determining distribution of each problem type?
Add problem format x^3-y^3
Add function to generate each type of problem as a word problem instead of an equation
Add check for negative values passed to geometry exercises
Rearrange type flags so similar level exercises are near each other (and specific types come after similar generic types)
